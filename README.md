# Monthly Sales Performance and Top Products Analysis
### Project Description
I assume the role of a data analyst, tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a fictional retail business from January to May 2019. My primary objective is to uncover trends, identify top-performing products, and provide actionable insights that drive business growth. I focus on monthly sales trends, product performance, and identifying key revenue drivers to inform strategic decisions.

### Through this analysis, I:
- Evaluate the overall sales performance of the business from January to May.
- Identify the top-selling products and determine which consistently perform well.
- Analyze trends and patterns in sales data to uncover potential seasonality or fluctuations in demand.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize product offerings and sales strategies based on the insights gained.

### Demonstrated Skills
- Data Analysis: I extract and analyze data from multiple monthly sales tables using SQL, focusing on key revenue and product performance metrics.
- Business Understanding: I develop an understanding of sales trends, product demand, and revenue drivers to provide relevant insights and recommendations.
- Decision-Making: I formulate actionable recommendations for optimizing product offerings and sales strategies based on data-driven insights.
- Data Visualization: I create visualizations using Tableau to effectively communicate key insights and trends in sales performance and product demand.
